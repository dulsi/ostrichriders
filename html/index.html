<p><h2>About</h2></p>

<p>Enemy knights are invading the kingdom. As one of the elite ostrich riders,
it is your duty to defend the kingdom. With lance in hand you fly off.
Remember to stay above your opponent least you fall to his lance. Collect the
eggs least your opponent hatches stronger than before. Work togther with other
knights.</p>

<p>Ostrich Riders is a free clone of the arcade game "Joust". Originally
developed by Seby with graphics by Suiland. They abandonned the project in
2009. This is a new continuation of the project.</p>

<p><h2>Recent News</h2></p>

<p>Febuary 28, 2019: Ostrich Riders 0.6.5 released. Added arcade mode with -a
argument. In arcade mode, only starting the game and exit are available.
Pressing 1 starts one player and pressing 2 starts two player. In the game if
someone dies they can press the appropriate number and join right back in.
Score is reset to 0. Right now high scores are not tracked. Eventually it
should be fixed to enter names like an arcade machine instead of requiring a
full keyboard.</p>

<p>September 15, 2016: Ostrich Riders 0.6.4 released. Support for more
highlighted entries on scoreboard than two.</p>

<p>March 10, 2016: Ostrich Riders 0.6.3 released. Multiple joystick support
added. Changed from a hard coded path to using fontconfig to find the font.
Detect if /usr/share/ostrichriders exists. If not found look in local data
directory for files.</p>

<p>Febuary 11, 2016: Ostrich Riders 0.6.2 released. Updated to the latest
SFML library. Added a third player. The images are simply color altered
versions of Suiland's original graphics.</p>
